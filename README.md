I'm a third-year Mechatronics student and AI Developer who is passionate about making AI accessible through interactive applications, creating technology to enhance personal and professional development, and building intelligent solutions with Large Language Models and multi-agent systems. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Python, AI frameworks like CrewAI and Scikit-learn, and Streamlit for rapid web development.
