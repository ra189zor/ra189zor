> ### **[YOUR NAME]**
>
> **AI Developer • Python Innovator • Career Tech Creator**
>
> [cite_start]> I'm an AI Developer who is passionate about building intelligent, user-centric applications using Python[cite: 6, 8]. [cite_start]I love creating technology to elevate people's professional and personal lives, with a focus on career advisory, interview coaching, and mental well-being[cite: 7, 10].

[cite_start]My work in career technology led me to develop **[JobNexus](https://github.com/ra189zor/jobnexus)**, a comprehensive career advisor powered by a multi-agent AI system I built with **CrewAI**[cite: 5]. [cite_start]I enjoy working with a modern tech stack that includes **Python**, **Streamlit**, and the **OpenAI API** to bring these ideas to life[cite: 6, 8].
